# POSThuman
> A POST for Humans
> Note: this is an early *alpha* work in progress

Wake up feeling groggy? Are you at 100%? 80%?

When a computer wake up, the firmware executes a power-on self-test (POST). This allows the software (mind) to know how the hardware (brain/body) is functioning and to detect if any problems exist that the system should be aware of when executing future tasks.

Likewise, POSThuman is designed to run a diagnostic on human functionality as a wake-up routine.

The exercises are designed to take about 10-15 minutes in total and test everything from hand-eye coordination to simple math mental dexterity to creative word association.

Additionally, many tasks are paired with minor, equipment-free physical stretching exercises.

Do this daily to track your score and improve each task.

> TODO: this would be great as an iOS app with videos demonstrating some of the activities

## Tasks

### Drawing
